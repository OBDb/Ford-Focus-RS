    description: "The original Ford Focus RS was a limited-production, high-performance variant of the first-generation European Focus. Powered by a turbocharged 2.0L Duratec RS engine producing 212 HP and 229 lb-ft of torque, it featured a Quaife limited-slip differential to help manage torque steer through its front-wheel drive layout. The exterior was distinguished by aggressive styling with a wider track, unique front bumper with larger air intakes, rear spoiler, and blue paint as the only color option. The interior featured Sparco bucket seats, blue accents, and a unique instrument cluster. Handling was enhanced through a substantially upgraded suspension with stiffer springs, revised geometry, and larger anti-roll bars. Limited to approximately 4,500 units and never officially sold in North America, the first-generation RS established the nameplate's reputation for hardcore performance within the hot hatch segment."

    end_year: 2010
    description: "The second-generation Focus RS was based on the European second-generation Focus platform and featured a turbocharged 2.5L five-cylinder engine derived from Volvo, producing 301 HP and 325 lb-ft of torque. Like its predecessor, it remained front-wheel drive but utilized an innovative 'RevoKnuckle' front suspension designed to mitigate torque steer and a Quaife limited-slip differential. The aggressive exterior styling included a prominent rear wing, wide body kit, and large front air intakes, available in a wider range of colors including the signature Ultimate Green. The interior featured heavily bolstered Recaro seats, carbon fiber accents, and RS-specific gauges. With 0-60 mph acceleration in 5.9 seconds and enhanced handling through comprehensive chassis upgrades, this generation further cemented the RS as an extreme performance variant of the Focus. Production was limited to around 11,500 units, with no official North American sales."

    end_year: 2018
    description: "The third-generation Focus RS represented the model's global debut, including its first official availability in North America. Built on the third-generation Focus platform, it featured a significant technical advancement with a sophisticated all-wheel drive system capable of torque vectoring across the rear axle, allowing for controlled drifts in its famous 'Drift Mode.' Powered by a turbocharged 2.3L EcoBoost four-cylinder engine producing 350 HP and 350 lb-ft of torque (with temporary overboost to 347 lb-ft), it was exclusively offered with a six-speed manual transmission. Performance was impressive with 0-60 mph acceleration in 4.7 seconds and a top speed of 165 mph. The exterior featured aggressive styling with a large rear wing, prominent diffuser, and unique front fascia, available in colors including the distinctive Nitrous Blue. The interior included heavily bolstered Recaro seats, blue accent stitching, and additional gauges. Handling was enhanced through adjustable dampers, Michelin Pilot Super Sport tires, and Brembo brakes. A special limited-edition RS500 model concluded production in 2018, featuring unique styling elements and mechanical upgrades. The third-generation RS garnered critical acclaim for its combination of everyday usability with exceptional performance capabilities, representing the ultimate expression of the Focus platform before the fourth-generation Focus moved away from the high-performance RS variant."
